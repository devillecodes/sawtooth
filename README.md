# A simple [Battlesnake](http://play.battlesnake.com) written in Go.

This is a basic implementation of the [Battlesnake API](https://docs.battlesnake.com/snake-api). This project was originally cloned from BattlesnakeOfficial/starter-snake-go.

This project is being built as part of a [100 Days Of Code](https://github.com/devillexio/100-days-of-code/blob/master/log.md) challenge, and also to learn more about Go.

### Technologies

This Battlesnake uses [Go 1.14](https://golang.org/) and [Heroku](https://heroku.com).

### Why Sawtooth?

The name _Sawtooth_ is a homage to one of my favorite games of all time, Diablo III.
